## Development

During the first day of this project, I didn’t get any inspiration, imagination in designing or any type of website thinking for this project. Until I slide into one of my favorite designer who I admire alot since 2022. His name is Willy Chavarria and he is from Brooklyn, New York. He had a very modern minimalist, industrialist, and politic concept of design. His challenging the concept in fashion industry, makes me wanted to do more with less. So, I decided to choose him as my website design subject. But in the moment I didn't get any specific idea until this several things came to me and one is influenced me the most is FKA Twigs Album called "Magdalene" to make this website even more thematic.

## Stages of Development

Along the way in the making of this website, my head is jumping back and forth with so many turmoil and chaotic overthinking. Asking same question every single day, “Could I challenge myself to do something that I never did before?” and “Can I done this before the deadline?”. So that question slowly shaping into challenging phases in my last 5 days and the result is this website containing multiple pages that I never did before with the following stages;

1. Header

2. Footer
![Footer](readme.md%20Documentation/Footer.png)

I put same header and foot for each web pages because this is multiple pages with just different section.

## Set Up & Run the Project
Here is some step I used to running a project from github:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Install extension called “GitHub Pull Request and Issues”
![Ext](readme.md%20Documentation/Running%20FIle.png)
3. Copy Link from Github, mine for Example “https://github.com/RevoU-FSSE-2/week-5-febriaaan22.git”
4. On VSCode search bar, type “>GitClone, it will appear Clone from GitHub and paste the link.
5. Make folder for the clone and click “Select as Repository Destination.
6. Now you can run the project.
