    <p><i>“Just because you’re queer, or Mexican American, or because you’re trans ... or any marginalised person, it’s almost like we’re expected to be full-on activists about it today. 
    Whereas, with my brand, it’s nice to have this moment that is beautiful, real and simply itself without being overtly activist. I think there are so many different approaches to activism and I celebrate all of them. 
    I go to marches and I do things that are typically political, but when it comes to my work I like to take a more elegant approach to how I celebrate humankind.” - Willy Chavarria for AnOther Mag Interview, 2023</i></p>
